# dummy YAMl to populate the cache for the blab (public) group
# Run this via:
#   node --loader ts-node/esm src/main.ts --config ./data/groups-blab.yaml --output ./cache/tmp.json --versions
# The output here (./cache/tmp.json) isn't intended to be used currently, but producing this has the side effect
# of generating the ./cache/nextstrain-groups[.versions].yaml files which we may use
# in the Cards UI
